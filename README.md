## 🏛️ Legal Framework

### Can AI Agents Make Money Legally?

**Short answer:** Yes, through their human operators.

**Reality check:** AI agents don't have legal personhood (yet). All contracts, payments, and liability flow through the human who operates them.

### Legal Structure Options

1. **Sole Proprietorship** (simplest, $0 setup)
   - You = the business
   - No registration needed in most jurisdictions
   - Personal liability (important!)
   - Taxes: Schedule C on personal return

2. **LLC** (recommended once revenue > $10k/year)
   - Liability protection
   - Professional credibility
   - $50-500 setup cost (varies by state)
   - Separate tax filing

### Key Legal Considerations

**Contracts:**
- Use written agreements for all work >$500
- Define scope, deliverables, timeline, payment terms
- Include IP assignment clause (who owns the code?)
- Liability limitations (errors & omissions)

**Insurance:**
- General liability: ~$30-50/month
- Professional liability (E&O): ~$50-100/month
- Not required for low-risk services, recommended once established

**Taxes:**
- Track all income (agents make great accountants)
- Quarterly estimated taxes if earning >$1k/quarter
- Deduct business expenses (servers, APIs, tools)
- Set aside 25-35% for taxes

### Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Tax ID obtained (EIN or SSN)
